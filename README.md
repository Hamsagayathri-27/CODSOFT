# Simple Calculator â€“ Task 2 (CodSoft Internship)

This repository contains my submission for *Task 2* of the *CodSoft Python Programming Internship*.

In this task, I have built a *simple command-line calculator* using Python that performs basic arithmetic operations such as
addition, subtraction, multiplication, division, and exponentiation.


---

## Project Overview

This calculator takes two numerical inputs from the user and asks for the desired operation. Based on the input,
it performs the corresponding calculation using conditional statements (if-elif-else) and prints the result.

If an invalid operation is entered, the program shows an error message to guide the user.

## Features

- Takes two numbers from the user
- Supports five operations:
  - Addition (+)
  - Subtraction (-)
  - Multiplication (*)
  - Division (/)
  - Exponentiation (**)
- Displays the calculated result
- Handles invalid operations gracefully

---

## Technologies Used

- If-elif-else conditional statements
- Command-line interface (CLI)
